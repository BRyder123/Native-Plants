  <p>To support native birds, consider installing bird feeders and bird baths in your garden. These provide supplementary food and water, especially during harsh weather conditions. Planting a variety of native flowers, shrubs, and trees can offer shelter and nesting sites for birds, enhancing their chances of survival and reproduction.
Avoid using pesticides and herbicides, as these chemicals can harm both plants and animals. Instead, opt for organic gardening practices that promote a healthy, balanced ecosystem. Additionally, participating in local conservation efforts, such as habitat restoration projects and citizen science initiatives, can make a significant impact.
Educating yourself and others about the importance of native species is also vital. By raising awareness and encouraging community involvement, you can help create a network of supportive habitats for native birds and flowers, ensuring their continued presence and the overall health of the environment. ðŸŒ¿ðŸ¦œ
